Implementation Steps:
#Import the dataset
#Check data description
#Check Missing value
#Check Unique values
#Transform the ‘Sex’ from object type to int type.
#Check missing value
#Create array for each attribute
#Calculate similarities for nominal, interval attributes.
#Combining the matrix
#Generate a csv file Similarity Matrix-final-project.csv.
#Create Histogram plot for count for each plot
#Create Boxplot for measuring outliers
#Create Pair plot
#The task is to predict the rings
#Outliers is seen from the graph
#We take the rings between 3 to 15
#Now we can see there is one outlier
#We then performed KNN classification and SVM classification for this data
#We done feature engineering by grouping the data into three types of rings.
#We calculated the classification report and accuracy for both steps 18 and 19
#Then we run the same program in Lamar Red HPC
#We login to the HPC
#We load the anaconda and python module
#Then we convert the ipynb file to python file by using the code: jupyter nbconvert --to python project_final.ipynb
#We run in the terminal by the command python project_final.py
